I tested the program with different kinds of arguments which included:
	
	1) Checked with both one and two arguments for temperature and wind velocity:
		1) For both these arguments I checked out of bound cases
		2) Extreme cases.
		3) Non numeric cases
	2) Checked with no arguments
	3) Checked arguments with negative signs.
